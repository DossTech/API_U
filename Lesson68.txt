So far from 68 and 69
1.An uuid is added in the params of "GET" - -----> it was randomly generating

2.We set it as Global variable by this code in GET
   
json = pm.response.json();
pm.globals.set("uuid",json.uuid);

3.Now passing that global variable key in "POST" in
params of POST as id = {{uuid}}  or
in Body
